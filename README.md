## Slime Boss for an Indie Platformer Game
I had the privilege of contributing to an indie platformer game developed by a small studio in Japan. My task was to develop a unique boss mechanic that would provide a challenging yet enjoyable experience for players. The focus of my work was on the Slime Boss, envisioned as one of the first key antagonists in the game.

Initially, I was provided with a basic enemy slime that had simple pathing and following behaviors. My responsibility was to transform this basic enemy into a more complex and engaging boss character. Within the first two days, I immersed myself in understanding the existing framework, analyzing the game's design documentation, and strategizing the development process.

By the third day, I had successfully implemented the attack and vulnerable states for the Slime Boss, along with its unique stats. By the fifth day, all the states were fully developed, and I shifted my focus to refining the boss's mechanics. This included coding stun effects, creating landing animations, and integrating sound effects to enhance the overall player experience.
